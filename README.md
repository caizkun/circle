A blog website powered by Flask

This project is intended for practicing web development using Flask. Many thanks to the guidance from [Flask Web Development](https://www.flaskbook.com/)!

The blog webiste was organized with **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** structural pattern in mind.
* Model: use [SQLAlchemy](http://flask-sqlalchemy.pocoo.org/2.3/) as a Object-Relation Mapper to manage database
* View: use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to create simple views
* Controller: use [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) to manage the logics
